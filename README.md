# CodeAlpha-DataVisualization
Data Visualization Project

This project is part of my CodeAlpha Internship, where I worked on exploring, analyzing, and visualizing data to uncover insights and trends.

Project Overview

The main goal of this project was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and present the findings using data visualization techniques. I used different types of charts and graphs to make the data easier to understand and interpret.

Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas – Data cleaning & manipulation

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Seaborn – Advanced visualization

Features

Cleaned and processed the dataset

Performed correlation analysis using Pearson method

Visualized data distributions, trends, and relationships

Created bar charts, pie charts, histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps for better insights

Highlighted key findings and patterns

Dataset

The dataset used contains information such as user activity, fitness parameters, and health stats (steps, calories burned, workouts, sleep hours, etc.).

Key Insights

Identified correlations between activity levels and calories burned

Observed trends in workout time, water intake, and sleep hours

Showed how visualization can simplify complex data for decision-making

Sample Visualizations

Pie chart showing activity distribution

Heatmap of correlations

Bar chart for calories burned vs. workout minutes

Learning Outcome

This project helped me improve my data analysis and visualization skills. I learned how to:

Handle missing data

Choose the right chart for the right type of data

Present insights in a clear and structured way
